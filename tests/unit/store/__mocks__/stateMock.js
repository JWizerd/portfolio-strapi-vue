This was the first of its kind that we had done at the The Taproom Agency. The portal turned out to be quite complex and was requirement to the default and obsolete version that ReCharge offered as the merchant has a very custom process with handling the swapping of a subscription products for another, and upgrading and downgrading subscriptions all of which were integrated through a series of re-suable services and components including a centralized service for handling secure communication between ReCharge's backend APIs and our portal frontends; written in Node.js/Express. The other components were built around the Vue.js frontend framework. Both strategic planning, and a lot of hard work during this project allowed to achieve the merchant's technology requirements while setting us up in the future for success in building custom full-stack ReCharge applications.",

My primary role in this project was to build a custom customer portal with single page experience and also provide the ability for merchants to manage features, layout and settings, similar to Shopify sections for themes but via a custom Shopify application; ReCharge currently doesn't provide this functionality. For the portal frontend, I utilized Vue.js, and its state management library, Vuex, heavily to ensure that the project was easy to manage and debug during the initial build and future iterations. For the backend I utilized two technologies, Strapi, an API generator and Next.js for the Shopify Admin Application. The fascinating part of this project was because of my strategic planning and process of building for re-usability the following customer portal applications such as this can now be developed in a matter of a couple days.",

This application is built using Vue.js for the frontend, automatically deployed via Netlify's free tier. On the backend I am using Strapi, an API generator and CMS that I use to rapidly build out the data layer for my applications. The backend is running inside of a docker container which is deployed to a free tier dyno on Heroku with a Postgres add-on. I'm excited to say that I believe this is only the beginning of this effort. While I did develop the entire application myself I have two other developer friends who want to assist in helping me build this into a platform that developer's can use to quickly generate portfolios, get realtime job postings as they come in via popular job sites such as Indeed. We're calling it unassigned.io!",

While most of the UI components were initially developed by me, the polishing of the UI was done by the rest of the team. My primary role in this project was to build out the logic heavy features such as the carpet calculator, GraphQL based catalog, and a state management system which is entirely managed via query params in the URL. Query Param state management was innovative idea I had to accommodate for many scenarios where the state of the form had to be managed across devices.",

This was the first of its kind that we had done at the The Taproom Agency. The portal turned out to be quite complex and was requirement to the default and obsolete version that ReCharge offered as the merchant has a very custom process with handling the swapping of a subscription products for another, and upgrading and downgrading subscriptions all of which were integrated through a series of re-suable services and components including a centralized service for handling secure communication between ReCharge's backend APIs and our portal frontends; written in Node.js/Express. The other components were built around the Vue.js frontend framework. Both strategic planning, and a lot of hard work during this project allowed to achieve the merchant's technology requirements while setting us up in the future for success in building custom full-stack ReCharge applications.",

My primary role in this project was to build a custom customer portal with single page experience and also provide the ability for merchants to manage features, layout and settings, similar to Shopify sections for themes but via a custom Shopify application; ReCharge currently doesn't provide this functionality. For the portal frontend, I utilized Vue.js, and its state management library, Vuex, heavily to ensure that the project was easy to manage and debug during the initial build and future iterations. For the backend I utilized two technologies, Strapi, an API generator and Next.js for the Shopify Admin Application. The fascinating part of this project was because of my strategic planning and process of building for re-usability the following customer portal applications such as this can now be developed in a matter of a couple days.",

This application is built using Vue.js for the frontend, automatically deployed via Netlify's free tier. On the backend I am using Strapi, an API generator and CMS that I use to rapidly build out the data layer for my applications. The backend is running inside of a docker container which is deployed to a free tier dyno on Heroku with a Postgres add-on. I'm excited to say that I believe this is only the beginning of this effort. While I did develop the entire application myself I have two other developer friends who want to assist in helping me build this into a platform that developer's can use to quickly generate portfolios, get realtime job postings as they come in via popular job sites such as Indeed. We're calling it unassigned.io!",

This is fine when you're managing your estate sale listings from a single location but making sure this data is always in sync with external estate sale listing providers is not an easy task. I'm proud to say that using Wordpress, PHP, MySQL, and the batch processing pattern, I was able to accomplish this task! ",
